# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. This assignment will help you understand API endpoints, request/response handling, and basic CRUD operations.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Create a Simple FastAPI Application

#### Description
Set up a basic FastAPI application that runs a web server and responds to HTTP requests.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Start a FastAPI server on localhost
- Provide a root endpoint ("/") that returns a welcome message
- Include clear comments and instructions for running the server


### 🛠️ Task 2: Implement CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Expand your FastAPI app to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a simple resource (e.g., items, books, or users).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a Pydantic model for your resource
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Creating a new resource (POST)
  - Reading all resources (GET)
  - Reading a single resource by ID (GET)
  - Updating a resource by ID (PUT)
  - Deleting a resource by ID (DELETE)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses

---

💡 **Tips for Success:**
- Use clear variable names and comments
- Test your endpoints with tools like curl or Postman
- Refer to the FastAPI documentation for examples
